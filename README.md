# Introduction
Hello, dear recruiter! Welcome to my project's README file. In this document, I will walk you through the solution process for the project I have been working on. The project involves creating a web application with three pages: entry page, edit page, and a list page, using various technologies like React, MUI, and Typescript.

# Project Requirements
The project's given requirements were as follows:
### Entry Page:
Allows the user to enter a URL and converts it to a unique short URL, saving both in Local Storage.
### Edit Page:
Enables users to update the long URL while displaying the read-only short URL.
### List Page:
Shows all saved links, allowing users to open the long URL in a new tab or edit the link.

# Solution Process
To ensure an organized development process, I followed these steps:

## Step 1 (AntD or MUI?)
To decide between AntD and MUI, I considered factors like the project's size, learning curve, and ease of use. I concluded that MUI is more suitable due to its shallow learning curve and good starting resources for beginners.

## Step 2 (CSS or Sass?)
I chose CSS instead of Sass. I used very few lines of CSS code. So, I found that using sass in unnecessary here.

## Step 3 (Typescript or JavaScript?)
Given the benefits of enhanced type safety and the manageable learning curve, I opted for Typescript as the programming language for the project.

## Step 4 (storybook?)
I considered using Storybook but decided to evaluate it later based on project progress and time constraints. If necessary, I will integrate it to aid development. (I could not manage the time to learn it).

# Project Work
I meticulously set up the project, following these steps:
1. Created a React project with Typescript, and set up a GitHub repository.
2. Configured GitHub Pages for easy deployment.
3. Integrated MUI into the project for consistent and visually appealing components.
4. Designed logos and icons to enhance the project's look and feel.
5. Implemented a responsive layout for different screen sizes.
6. Developed a navigation bar that adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
7. Created the Entry Page with the necessary UI components.
8. Implemented functionalities like generating unique short URLs, input validation, and copy and save functions.
9. Stored short and long URLs in Local Storage for persistent data.
10. Created the edit page. I implemented a modal to edit the long URL and implemented a delete button to delete a specific URL.
11. Finally created the list page to show all the short URLs. Clicking the short URL takes the user to a new tab with the long URL.
# Conclusion
Thank you for reviewing my project. I hope this overview provides you with a clear understanding of my solution process and the technologies I used for this project. I look forward to discussing it further in our conversation. I appreciate your time and consideration!

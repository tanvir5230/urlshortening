Project Readme
I. Introduction
Hello, dear recruiter! Welcome to my project's README file. In this document, I will walk you through the solution process for the project I have been working on. The project involves creating a web application with three pages: entry page, edit page, and list page, using various technologies like React, MUI, Sass, and Typescript.

II. Project Requirements
The project's given requirements were as follows:

1. Technologies to Use
   React
   MUI (Material UI) as the chosen React framework
   Sass for styling
   Typescript for enhanced type safety
   Storybook (considered, but not finalized for inclusion)
2. What to Submit
   My CV as a PDF in the project repository
   A detailed solution description in this README.md file
   A completed submission form
3. Required Components of the Project
   Entry Page:
   Allows the user to enter a URL and converts it to a unique short URL, saving both in Local Storage.
   Edit Page:
   Enables users to update the long URL while displaying the read-only short URL.
   List Page:
   Shows all saved links, allowing users to open the long URL in a new tab or edit the link.
   III. Solution Process
   To ensure an organized development process, I followed these steps:

Step 1 (AntD or MUI?)
To decide between AntD and MUI, I considered factors like the project's size, learning curve, and ease of use. I concluded that MUI is more suitable due to its shallow learning curve and good starting resources for beginners.

Step 2 (CSS or Sass?)
I chose Sass for styling, considering its simplicity and ease of learning. Sass will allow me to maintain a well-structured and modular codebase for the project.

Step 3 (Typescript or JavaScript?)
Given the benefits of enhanced type safety and the manageable learning curve, I opted for Typescript as the programming language for the project.

Step 4 (storybook?)
I considered using Storybook but decided to evaluate it later based on project progress and time constraints. If necessary, I will integrate it to aid development.

IV. Project Work
I meticulously set up the project, following these steps:

Created a React project with Typescript, and set up a GitHub repository.
Configured GitHub Pages for easy deployment.
Integrated MUI into the project for consistent and visually appealing components.
Designed logos and icons to enhance the project's look and feel.
Implemented a responsive layout using Sass to cater to different screen sizes.
Developed a navigation bar that adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
Created the Entry Page with necessary UI components.
Implemented functionalities like generating unique short URLs, input validation, and copy/save functions.
Stored short and long URLs in Local Storage for persistent data.
Planned to work on Edit and List Pages next, as outlined in the project requirements.
V. Conclusion
Thank you for reviewing my project's README file. I hope this overview provides you with a clear understanding of my solution process and the technologies I used for this project. I look forward to discussing it further in our conversation. If you have any questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. I appreciate your time and consideration!
